# ROOK | Room Availability Checking Service

**Version 1.0.2**

This project was created by AUA students aiming to help the AUA community to use the AUA rooms more efficiently during the busy year times.

## Data Structure
Currently, the data of the project is held in a JSON structure; in the future, we aim to move the data to the NoSQL database. 

## Final Goal
The final goal of the project is to have a working website which will help AUA students to book and manage their bookings within the AUA.
